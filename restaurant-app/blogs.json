A faster turnover means more revenue, but a poor guest experience means they may never come back. So, how do you find that perfect balance?"

With a QR-based system, guests can scan a code on their table to browse your menu, place their order, and send it directly to the kitchen. This frees up your servers to focus on what they do best: answering questions, making recommendations, and ensuring guests have an exceptional experience. This simple shift can shave minutes off each table, and those minutes add up fast."
